# Study Recruitment Social Media Post

Hi,

Have you programmed before? Have you ever tried cannabis use during programming? Have
you wondered about the effect of cannabis use on oneâ€™s programming ability? We are
researchers from the Computer Science department at the University of Michigan, and are
carrying out a study to observe the effects of cannabis use on programmers. We are seeking
participants for two one-and-a-half-hour remote sessions, one while you are intoxicated by smoked or
vaped cannabis and one while you are sober. (Institutional Review Board approved ID
#HUM00223584).

In each session, you are expected to complete:
* A set of small programming tasks (e.g., change this program code to remove a bug, complete a partial program to obtain required functionality, etc.)
* Three open-ended "interview style" coding questions
* small number of standardized psychological tests (e.g., n-back recall task, a spatial reasoning task, etc.)

To participate in the study, we expect you to:
* be 21 years old and above,
* have used cannabis in the last year,
* have vaped or smoked cannabis before
* have a programming experience at the level of at least a senior undergraduate, and be familiar with Python
* Have a personally-owned computer you can use to join the remote zoom call

Participants will be compensated $80. The study will be conducted via Zoom. We will de-identify
all personally identifiable data and your information will be protected and secure.

If you are interested in participating and you think that you are eligible to do so, please fill out
[this survey](https://umich.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_bkYx5snn7xqcvye):

You will then be contacted by the research team if you are selected to participate
within two weeks. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the study team using the emails below.
